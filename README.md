# Self-Signing Code

This repository contains:
- The documentation explaining, step by step, how to [sign your code yourself](https://jeayne.github.io/Self-Signing_Code/) on Windows (for free)
- Five simple Windows [scripts](https://github.com/JEAYNE/Self-Signing_Code/tree/main/demo) `(.bat)` that do what is described in the documentation.

At the end, you get the `HelloWord.exe` programme signed with your certificate validated by your own private Certification Authority (CA).
